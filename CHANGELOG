Changes since c99128
====================
1) unquote will now get the value of a symbol if it has one and
   automatically apply unquote to that value. So:
    
    [1 2 +] ! => 3
    foo ! => foo
    [1 2 +] foo set foo ! => 3
    
   This reduces the need for a ';' to get the value of a symbol
   before unquoting it. So code like:
    
    dup;!drop;!dip;!
    
   can be
    
    dup!drop!dip
