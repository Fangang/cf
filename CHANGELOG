====================
1) Math operators on sequences works so that the math operator
   is applied per element on the sequence. eg:

     [1 2 3] 2 +       => [3 4 5]
     [1 2 3] [4 5 6] + => [5 7 9]

====================
1) Major primitive word change. unquote '!' is now .
   This change was made to make typing cf code easier without
   needing to use the shift key so often. The '.' is also less
   visually jarring and provides more whitespace between words.
    
   The old '.' is now 'printnl'. I need to think of a better name
   for that.
    
   So old code:
    
    5 fac!
    
   New code:
    
    5 fac.

2) Impovements to list join and uncons operations. Reference
   counts are checked to see if objects can be modified directly
   instead of copied. Appends are done lazily.

====================
1) unquote will now get the value of a symbol if it has one and
   automatically apply unquote to that value. So:
    
    [1 2 +] ! => 3
    foo ! => foo
    [1 2 +] foo set foo ! => 3
    
   This reduces the need for a ';' to get the value of a symbol
   before unquoting it. So code like:
    
    dup;!drop;!dip;!
    
   can be
    
    dup!drop!dip
